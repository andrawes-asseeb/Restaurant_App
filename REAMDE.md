# Fast Food Restaurant Project 🍔

> **Note:** I originally took this website idea from Free HTML Templates, but I made it all my own and I added some changes, so it is now unique and different from the original.

## Features I Implemented

1. **Dark Mode Button** – Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
2. **Sticky Header** – The header stays visible at the top of the page when scrolling.
3. **Separate Pages** – Each page is now separate; content no longer appears on the main page, giving each section its own dedicated space.
4. **No Map Added** – I decided not to include a map as it was not necessary for this project.
